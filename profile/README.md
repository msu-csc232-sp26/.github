Missouri State University, Spring 2026.

## Course Syllabus

### Instructor Contact Information

**Instructor Name**: Jim Daehn<br />
**Email**: [jdaehn@missouristate.edu](mailto:jdaehn@missouristate.edu)<br />
**Office Hours**: By appointment (generally, via remote video conferencing)<br />
**Office Location**: Graduate Library, Cheek Hall

#### Communication Expections

Emails received during the week (Monday – Friday) will be responded to within 24 hours. Emails received over the weekend or during breaks/holidays will receive a response within 48 hours (about 2 days). Since I work full time outside of the university, I may not always answer the phone (or immediately respond to text messages). However, I’ll respond to any text messages or voicemail as soon as possible.

For class related questions, please use the appropriate channel in Microsoft Teams. For example, questions related to course material should be asked in the “Lectures” channel; questions related to labs should be asked in the “Labs” Channel, etc. I will check the Teams channels daily and will answer questions as needed. I also highly encourage students to read and respond to postings from their classmates. Part of the nature of this class is for students to help each other with troubleshooting problems and develop critical-thinking skills and working through questions on the channel discussions is an excellent method to develop proficiency in these areas. 

### Student Success

At Missouri State University we are committed to student success. A key element to your success as a student is to engage in all course activities and to communicate with your instructor. If you anticipate or experience academic barriers during the course, contact your instructor right away so you can discuss options. 

### Course Description

Prerequisite: "C" or better in CSC 131; and MTH 261 or MTH 314 or MTH 315 or concurrent enrollment. A continuation of CSC 131. Topics will include algorithm design; complexity analysis; abstract data types and encapsulation; basic data structures and their application, including stacks, queues, linked lists and binary trees; dynamic memory allocation; recursion; sorting and searching; debugging techniques. 4 credit hours (3 lecture hours, 2 lab hours) 

### Learning Outcomes

Assessment is a process used by instructors to help improve learning. Assessment is essential for effective learning because it provides feedback to both students and instructors. A critical step in this process is making clear the course’s student learning outcomes that describe what students are expected to learn to be successful in the course. The student learning outcomes for this course are listed below. By collecting data and sharing it with students on how well they are accomplishing these learning outcomes, students can more efficiently and effectively focus their learning efforts. 
 
This information can also help instructors identify challenging areas for students and adjust their teaching approach to facilitate learning. 
 
Upon completion of this course, students will:

* Demonstrate an understanding of the fundamentals of object-oriented design and programming. 
* Know the concepts of several techniques of data organization (lists, stacks, queues, trees, etc.).
* Recognize those types of data organization within human problem solving.
* Define a solution to a problem, where the solution is expressed in terms of algorithms, data structures, classes, functions, methods, etc.
* Use the C++ language to implement several techniques of data organization.
* Use language documentation to determine the existence and use of language-provided code, such as data structures and classes.
* Describe and apply basic algorithm analysis.
* Be familiar with the principles of software engineering.

### Required Course Materials

#### Textbook

Carrano, Frank, M., and Timothy M. Henry. _Secure Data Structures and Algorithms with C++_. Available from: VitalSource Bookshelf (8th Edition). Pearson Education (US), 2024. 
 
#### Technology

The use of technology is a part of our everyday lives at the university and there is essential information you should know about your own computer capabilities, Internet access, Teams, and other technology tools whether you are participating in a classroom on campus or taking an online class. For information on the basic computer requirements to be successful in class, visit the [Knowledge Base for Computer Requirements](https://missouristate.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1931/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=107376) on the Missouri State University website.

It is strongly recommended that, in addition to your standard means of access, you have an alternative plan for acquiring course materials, should your computer fail to function, or your Internet connection becomes disrupted.  The MSU campus library is an excellent option if it is nearby; otherwise, most public libraries offer Internet access.  If you have a laptop computer, then familiarity with local “hotspots” might also serve you well.  It is your responsibility to address technical problems actively and proactively, therefore, develop a plan to address technical problems before they arise. If you need assistance, the MSU helpdesk may be able to help. The MSU helpdesk can be reached by phone at 417-836-5891 or by emailing [HelpDesk@MissouriState.edu](mailto:helpdesk@missouristate.edu). You can also visit the [Help Desk website](http://helpdesk.missouristate.edu/) for a live chat option. 

Explore the [Accessibility website](https://www.missouristate.edu/accessibility/) to learn about the ways that we are working to improve accessibility at MSU.

### Course Specific Policies

#### Participation/Attendance

Attendance will be taken daily. I am required to report non-attendance to the university; this is related to financial aid.

**Note**: Attendance does not factor _directly_ into your final grade.

In addition to attending classes, I expect my students to participate often, both in the classroom and online. Please note that simply logging into the course site does not count as participation. As mentioned above, participation does not contribute towards your final grade. However, experience has shown that students that actively engage in their online elements of their courses tend to perform better than those that do not. 

#### Course Schedule

Our class “week” will begin on Monday and end on Sunday. Laboratory assignments must be submitted (via Brightspace) by the end of the lab period unless I have given specific instruction through the course announcements stating otherwise.  Review the Course Schedule for an overview of the schedule and the due dates for each week. New assignments (if applicable) and discussion board questions will become available as scheduled on Brightspace. The Course Schedule is found on Brightspace in the Administrivia module. 

#### Netiquette/Civility

Faculty at MSU are committed to developing and actively protecting a class environment in which respect must be shown to everyone to facilitate and encourage the expression, testing, understanding, and creation of a variety of ideas and opinions. You may find the [Core Rules of Netiquette](http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html) helpful for information on proper conduct when interacting with others online.

Rude, sarcastic, obscene, or disrespectful posts have a negative impact on everyone's learning and will not be tolerated. As the instructor, I reserve the right to remove any discussion I deem to be disrespectful or offensive. Any person engaging in disrespectful or disruptive behavior will be subject to the university’s misconduct policy outlined in the [Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities](https://www.missouristate.edu/policy/G5_01_StudentRightsandResponsibilities.htm).

#### Late Submission Policy

Late submissions are subject to the following penalty schedule:

* Submissions that are (0, 24] hours late are penalized 20%
* Submissions that are (24, 48] hours late are penalized 40%
* Submissions received 48 hours (2 days) beyond the due date are not graded and shall receive no credit.

### Course Grading

### University Policies

#### Accessibility/Academic Accommodation

If you are a student with a disability and anticipate barriers related to this course, it is important to request accommodation and establish an accommodation plan with the University. Please contact the Disability Resource Center (DRC) at the [Disability Resource Center](https://www.missouristate.edu/disability/) website, Meyer Library, Suite 111, 417-836-4192, to initiate the process to establish your accommodation plan. The DRC will work with you to establish your accommodation plan, or it may refer you to other appropriate resources based on the nature of your disability. To prepare an accommodation plan, the University usually requires that students provide documentation relating to their disability. Please be prepared to provide such documentation if requested. Once a university accommodation plan is established, you may notify the class instructor of approved accommodation. If you wish to utilize your accommodation plan, it is suggested that you do so in a timely manner, preferably within the first two weeks of class. Early notification to the instructor allows for full benefit of the accommodations identified in the plan. Instructors will not receive the accommodation plan until you provide that plan and are not required to apply for accommodation retroactively. 

#### Dropping a Class

It is your responsibility to understand the University’s procedure for dropping a class. If you stop attending this class but do not follow proper procedure for dropping the class, you will receive a failing grade and will also be financially obligated to pay for the class. For information about dropping a class or withdrawing from the university, contact the Office of the Registrar at 836-5520. You can access the [Academic Calendar](https://www.missouristate.edu/registrar/academic-calendar.htm) on the MSU website to view drop and refund deadlines for the semester.

#### Academic Integrity Policy

Missouri State University is a community of scholars committed to developing educated people who accept the responsibility to practice personal and academic integrity. You are responsible for knowing and following the university’s academic integrity policy plus additional more specific policies for each class. The university policy, formally known as the “Student Academic Integrity Policies and Procedures” is available online at [Academic Integrity Policies and Procedures (Students)](https://www.missouristate.edu/policy/Op3_01_AcademicIntegrityStudents.htm) and at the Reserves Desk in Meyer Library.  
 
Examples of academic integrity violations include allowing someone else to copy or use your assignments or exams, turning in papers used in other courses or from the internet, and/or using notes or your book for a closed-book exam. Plagiarism means presenting someone else’s work as your own (e.g., copying or paraphrasing someone else’s work without appropriate citations). Any student participating in any form of academic dishonesty will be subject to sanctions as described in this policy. 

#### Nondiscrimination Policy

Missouri State University is an equal opportunity/affirmative action institution and maintains a grievance procedure available to any person who believes he or she has been discriminated against. At all times, it is your right to address inquiries or concerns about discrimination to the Office for Institutional Equity and Compliance, Park Central Office Building, 117 Park Central Square, Suite 111, (417) 836-4252. Other types of concerns (i.e., concerns of an academic nature) should be discussed directly with your instructor and can be brought to the attention of your instructor’s Department Head. Please visit the [OEC](https://www.missouristate.edu/equity/) (Office for institutional Equity and Compliance for additional information. 

#### Religious Accommodation

The University may provide reasonable accommodation based on a person’s religious belief. In making this determination, the University reviews a variety of factors, including whether the accommodation would create an undue hardship. The accommodation request imposes responsibilities and obligations on both the individual requesting the accommodation and the University. Students who expect to miss classes, examinations, or other assignments because of their held religious belief shall be provided with a reasonable alternative opportunity to complete such academic responsibilities. It is the obligation of students to provide faculty with reasonable notice of the dates of religious observances on which they will be absent by submitting a Request for Religious Accommodation Form to the instructor by the end of the third week of a full semester course or the end of the second week of a half semester course.

#### Mental Health & Management

As a student, you may experience a range of personal issues that can impede learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance and may reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. Learn Visit the [Missouri State University Counseling Center website](https://counselingcenter.missouristate.edu/) to learn more about free and confidential services available to assist you. 

#### Title IX

Missouri State University has a Title IX policy that guides our response to instances of sexual violence. Sexual Violence includes Rape, Sexual Assault, Sexual Misconduct, Sexual Discrimination, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Stalking, Sexual Harassment and Pregnancy issues. The Title IX policy can be located on the [MSU Title IX website](https://www.missouristate.edu/titleix/). This website is also a valuable resource for any questions or issues involving Title IX and contains contact information for the MSU Title IX Office and staff.   
 
If an MSU student discloses a Title IX related issue to a MSU faculty or staff member who is deemed to be a “Responsible Employee” under the policy, that faculty or staff member is required to report such disclosure to the Title IX Coordinator. A responsible employee includes any employee who has the authority to take action to redress sexual violence; who has been given the duty of reporting incidents of sexual violence or any other misconduct by students to the Title IX Coordinator or other appropriate school designee; or whom a student could believe has the authority or duty to act. Taylor Health employees and MSU Counseling Center Clinicians are not considered to be Responsible Employees under the policy, and therefore, are not required to report Title IX issues to the Title IX Coordinator.

#### Chosen Name Policy

A student may choose a name other than their legal name to identify with Missouri State University. The chosen name is different than the student’s legal name. Refer to the [Chosen Name policy](https://www.missouristate.edu/policy/Op1_07_ChosenName.htm) for more information. Students can provide their chosen first and middle names in the _Profile_ tab of [My Missouri State](https://my.missouristate.edu/).
